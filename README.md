# COVID-19-Analysis

Analysis of available data of COVID incidences in order to visualize the dynamic of the COVID-19 outbreak mainly in european countries.

I am physicist with a passion for analyzing an modeling data. Since I am not a medical professional or an epidemiologist please consider the things presented here as my personal analysis of the open available pandemic data. I will include the code I used for analysis maybe it helps to make faster progress with your own projects.
