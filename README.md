# COVID-19-Analysis
Analysis of available data of COVID incidences in order to visualize the dynamic of the COVID outbreak mainly in europe

I am physicist with a passion for analyzing an modeling data. Since I am not a medical professional or an epidemiologist please consider the things presented here as my personal analysis of the open available pandemic data.




So far, I analysed two periods, the begining and the end of march, separately to show how the doubling time has changed over time. The observed increase in doubling time by approimately a factor of 2 might be considered as the result of the social distancing and quarantine measures, that were intensified in european countries around the 15. of March 2020.
